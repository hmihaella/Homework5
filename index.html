              Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that
              specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services
              headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is
              the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8
              billion in 2021) and as of May 2022, it is the world's second
              biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest
              personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile
              phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information
              technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and
              Microsoft.

              Ireland's Data Protection Commission also launched a privacy
              investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR
              law following an investigation into how the company processes
              personal data with targeted ads on its platform. In December 2019,
              a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location
              and collecting user data even after users have disabled location
              services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location
              Services icon "appears for system services that do not have a
              switch in settings." According to published reports by Bloomberg
              News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone
              numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as
              law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law
              enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real
              or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple
              representative referred the reporter to a section of the company
              policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, "We review
              every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems
              and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect
              abuse."
